During the Python Live Project I created an MVC application in Visual Studio. The application took entries for local weather, recorded date and time for those entries, 
passed them into a SQL Database, retrieved the entries upon request and displayed them on a view page. Further formatting of the application was done using CSS and Bootstrap.
